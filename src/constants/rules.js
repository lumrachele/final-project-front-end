Each player will take turns with the computer and submit their answers individually. They can submit as many answers as they like until the time is up. It's time to vote. All players (except the host) can decide as a group which captions are the Top 3 closest to the original prompt. The original prompt is hiding somewhere amongst the submitted answers.

export const onlineRules = "On start of the game, the host will be given a prompt (think charades) and will have 5 seconds to pose for a picture. The photo is dispatched to the game room, and each player guesses (as many times as they like before time is up) what they think the original prompt was. All the submissions are sent to the voting stage and each player can vote on their top three choices for captions that are closest to the original prompt. The original prompt is hiding somewhere amongst the submitted answers. The answer with the highest amount of points is the winner, and the original prompt is revealed."
